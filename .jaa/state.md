## EterOS VFS Update (Current Run)
- Addressed multiple POSIX and security gaps in `kernel/fs/initrd.c` and `kernel/fs/vfs.c`.
- Fixed buffer overflows in `initrd_readdir` and `initrd_finddir` by properly capping `file_headers[i].name` string copies to 64 chars and ensuring null-termination.
- Implemented robust nested path handling in `initrd_mkdir` by capturing and resolving the parent's directory prefix, preventing incorrect sub-directory indexing and `/etc/test` creation failures.
- Enabled test suite execution with fixes for `test_initrd_overflow` which explicitly verifies the length limits and leak prevention.
- All host tests, including newly enabled initrd bounds checks, are passing successfully.

# JAA Context State

## EterOS Scheduler & IPC Update (2024-04-24)
- Resolved a critical bug in `kernel/task.c:schedule()` where tasks selected to run again without switching context were not removed from the ready queue if they had been previously enqueued, corrupting the ready list.
- Addressed thread-safety issues in state transitions within `kernel/futex.c:futex_wait()` and `kernel/sem.c:sem_wait()` by introducing and utilizing a new locked `task_block()` API.
- Fixed `task_sleep()` by removing an arbitrary uninterruptible `hlt` busy wait.
- Tested and verified fixes via host-based unit tests (`test_sem`, `test_futex_logic`, `test_futex_timeout`) and a QEMU headless boot, ensuring Ring 3 interactions (`login.elf`) execute robustly under corrected load.

## EterOS Orchestrator Audit (2026-04-23)
- Executed `make clean` and `make all`. Verified `build/kernel.img` and `build/initrd.img` build successfully.
- Executed `bash tests/run_tests.sh`. Verified all host C tests passed with success.
- Executed QEMU headless boot test (`timeout 30s qemu-system-x86_64 -display none -m 128M...`). Boot transitioned successfully to Ring 3 invoking `login.elf` and displaying `eterOS login: `.
- Checked `.jaa.md` state instructions and codebase capabilities (`shell`, `lwip` config).
- Updated `ORCHESTRATOR_REPORT.md` (Commit 432e92f7822bcd212bff999925dbdbebf37b182f) with findings: Real codebase lacks native `gethostbyname` DNS integration (uses hardcoded UDP), JFS runs only in RAM without disk sync, and `login.elf` requires `/etc/passwd` connection to complete multi-user bootstrap.
- Set priority cycle for agents: `network-socket-api-bot`, `vfs-posix-filesystem-bot`, `users-security-panel-bot`, and `linux-syscall-compliance-bot`.

## EterOS VFS Update (2024-04-22)
- Evaluated and secured `vfs_lookup` path traversal vulnerabilities (added 127 char segment limit to prevent buffer overflow attacks).
- Implemented core VFS stub tests for POSIX capabilities (`test_vfs_mkdir`, `test_sys_openat`, `test_sys_rw_perms`) to validate basic OS mechanics like node type constraints.
- Analyzed `kernel/fs/elf.c` to confirm `PT_INTERP` boundary validation and execution mapping.
- Current build is QEMU-tested successfully loading Ring 3 `login.elf`.
